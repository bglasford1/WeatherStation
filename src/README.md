This the directory where all the java source code resides.  The two programs here are WeatherStation.java which is the main program and 
Simulator.java which is in consolesimulator directory.  I use IntelliJ Idea to compile the software and bundle it with the other essential
directories to form a WeatherStation.jar file that is deployed to the target Raspberry PI server.
