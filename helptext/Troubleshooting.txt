Troubleshooting:

The basic indication that something is wrong is looking at the command window that launched the application.  Any unhandled exceptions will print here.  

Expected issues will print in the log file located in the same directory where the jar file is located.  This file contains issues that are expected.

The main issues that will cause trouble are related to the communications protocol with the console.  The main window contains a telltale that shows when and what command is running.  The "LOOP" command runs once every 5 seconds.  This data is used to update the main window which displays the current values.  The "DMPAFT" command runs once every 5 minutes and receives data that is written to the database files for future graphing.  The "HILOW" command retrieves hi/low values that also feeds the main window.  This command runs whenever the current reading's hi/low span is changed.  There are other miscellaneous commands such as "TEST", "RXCHECK", etc.

The LOOP and DMPAFT commands can be turned on/off using the main menu's Test -> Loop Data and Test -> DMP Data features.  

Details of the communications protocol can be captured by turning on the main menu's Test -> Capture Data.  This creates a file named debug.txt in the tmp directory.  Raw data being send and received from the console are captured along with the general flow of the serial driver.
