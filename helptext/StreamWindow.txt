Stream Window:

The Stream Window is used to graph both raw data and calculated data in real time.  The color of the lines is modified using the main menu's Color sub-menu.  

There are three graphs to display the streaming data.  The data being plotted is modified using the Add/Remove menu item.  Each graphable item contains a checkbox.  

Click on the y-axis labels to change the y-axis values.  A pop-up menu is displayed to select a new y-axis. 

The x-axis time span is modified by selecting this window's Interval menu item.  The selections are 1/2 day, day, 1/2 week, week, 1/2 month and month.    

The calculated values are: Wind Chill, Heat DD, Cool DD, Dew Point, Heat Index, THW, THSW, ET, and Wind Run.

The current graph can be saved and brought up upon subsequent stream window display.  This is accomplished by using the menu's Make Default.
