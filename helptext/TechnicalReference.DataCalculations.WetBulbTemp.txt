Wet Bulb Temperature:

The wet bulb temperature calculation is based on a paper by Ronald Still named "Wet-Bulb Temperature from Relative Humidity and Air Temperature" dated 28 August 2011.  

The equation is:

Tw = T * atan[0.151977(RH% + 8.313659)1/2 ] + atan(T + RH%) - atan(RH% - 1.676331)
+ 0.00391838(RH%)3/2 atan(0.023101RH%) - 4.686035

Where temperatures are degrees C.
