Graph Window:

The Graph Window is used to graph both raw data and calculated data.  The color of the lines is modified using the main menu's Color sub-menu.  

The data being plotted is modified using the Add/Remove menu item.  Each graphable item contains a checkbox.  

Click on the y-axis label to change the y-axis values.  A pop-up menu is displayed to select a new y-axis. 

The x-axis time span is modified by selecting this window's Graph -> Date/Duration menu item.  A date picker dialog box is displayed.  Use the "..." Button to bring up a date picker dialog box.  Below the end date is a time span selector.  The selections are 1/2 day, day, 1/2 week, week, 1/2 month, month and year.  Selecting the year takes a while to read and calculate all the data.  

The calculated values are: Wind Chill, Heat DD, Cool DD, Dew Point, Heat Index, THW, THSW, ET, and Wind Run.

The current graph can be saved and brought up upon subsequent graph window display.  This is accomplished by using the menu's Graph -> Make Default.
