# WeatherStation
This weather station software interfaces with a Davis Vantage Pro II weather station.  The software interfaces to the console using the Davis supplied adapter.  I have owned the weather station since 2005.  The Davis weather station is in my opinion the best personnal weather station available, however their supplied software interface is rudimentary and does not meet my needs.  

My goal is to create software with a more intuitive GUI interface, better graphing capabilities, better data analysis, integrated NOAA alerts, sun/moon rise/set times, all in a single program that can run on a small Raspberry PI driving a small 10" HDMI screen for daily use and can run on a laptop/desktop for data analysis.
